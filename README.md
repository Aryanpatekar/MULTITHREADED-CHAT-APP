 The application follows a client-server architecture where a central server listens for incoming connections and manages communication between clients. The server is responsible for accepting multiple client requests, broadcasting messages, and ensuring smooth data transmission. Java provides key networking classes such as ServerSocket and Socket from the java.net package for establishing connections, while multithreading is implemented using Thread or ExecutorService to manage concurrent client sessions. When a client connects to the server, a separate thread is spawned to handle its communication independently, allowing multiple users to send and receive messages simultaneously. Input and output streams (DataInputStream, DataOutputStream, BufferedReader, and PrintWriter) are used for message exchange between clients and the server. Synchronization mechanisms, such as synchronized blocks or ConcurrentHashMap, ensure thread safety and prevent data inconsistencies in shared resources. The chat application supports essential features like private and group messaging, user authentication, message history, and client disconnection handling.
